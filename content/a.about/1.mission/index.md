The Nation of God and Christ is a global, ecumenical spiritual nation, divinely established to proclaim the love of Jesus Christ to the whole world, guided solely by Scripture and Godâ€™s Law. We are committed to fostering global spiritual unity, creating Kingdom leaders, and building self-sustaining communities through holistic development, encompassing spiritual, educational, environmental, mental, physical, social, and economic well-being.

We welcome every individual into fellowship, prioritizing relational engagement, grace, and dignity over coercion, even while upholding biblical moral standards and acknowledging sin. Our mission is to spread the good news through evangelistic and humanitarian outreach, ensuring every person has the opportunity to hear, understand, and receive the gospel, and to empower individuals to serve Christ and others in joyful submission to His authority, thereby carrying out the foundational vision of our General Minister/President

We pursue this by emulating a 'Jesus' model of engaging all individuals directly with mercy and relational presence, and by equipping a Spirit-filled Church to take the whole gospel to the whole world
