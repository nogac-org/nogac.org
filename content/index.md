The Musetta Stone Foundation is a public benefit corporation dedicated to empowering communities through education, creativity, and career opportunities. We operate professional services to fund our mission: providing a constructive, safe haven for youth and those in need.

We reinvest our resources directly into the communities we serve, providing vital programs and support systems as a positive alternative to the streets.

We provide accessible, career-focused training in high-demand creative and technical fields. Our curricula are designed to provide pathways to real-world opportunities.

Our commercial entities provide top-tier professional services while creating internship and career opportunities for our students. Every project you hire us for directly supports our community programs.

We build and maintain our own open-source projects. These tools power our AI development services and are freely available to empower students, developers, and the global community.

We are pioneering the future of emergency services by injecting mental health rapid response directly into the 911 system. Our goal is to de-escalate crises, provide immediate expert care, and build safer communities for everyone.

Our full-circle model is designed to create tangible career outcomes. We train, mentor, and hire from within our own community.
