The Nation of God and Christ (Nogac) is more than your typical church organization; it's a movement aimed at holistic development. We are committed to expanding our reach and influence through a multi-faceted organizational structure that encompasses both non-profit and for-profit entities to serve our communities effectively.

Our vision is a global network of self-sustaining villages, united in faith and purpose, where every individual has the opportunity to thrive spiritually, physically, and economically.

NOGAC uses Seven Pillars of Holistic Health as our framework for building balanced, healthy, and spiritually fulfilled lives and communities.

Our organizational structure is a unique, integrated structure designed to maximize our impact while maintaining our spiritual focus and non-profit status.

NOGAC employs a Village Concept designed for building self-sustaining communities owned and governed by the Church Community, built from the ground up to support holistic health and spiritual growth.

Our flagship village, Redemption Village, will be situated on 36.5 acres in eastern Arizona on land pledged by the founders and serves as the blueprint for our global vision. It integrates all seven pillars into a cohesive strategy for community development using a Global-Sustainability Systems and Key Initiatives and Specialized programs to educate our leaders and care for our communities.
